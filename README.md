Here are some of my notable projects:

1. [Project-Fake_news_classifier]([https://github.com/safiqurrahmang7/Project-Fake_news_classifier](https://github.com/safiqurrahmang7/Project-Fake_news_classifier/blob/main/README.md)) - The Fake News Classifier is an advanced deep learning project designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake. Using the WELFake dataset of over 72,000 news articles, the project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis. The model employs LSTM architecture to analyze text patterns and classify misinformation accurately. The project aims to combat the spread of fake news in the media and entertainment domain by providing an automated solution with a high F1-score. Deliverables include a well-documented Jupyter notebook, test dataset predictions, and a robust classification system.
